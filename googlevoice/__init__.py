This project aims to bring the power of the Google Voice API to the Python language in a simple,
easy-to-use manner. Currently it allows you to place calls, send sms,
download voicemails/recorded messages, and search the various folders of your Google Voice Accounts.
You can use the Python API or command line script to schedule calls, check for new received calls/sms,
or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.
Works for Python 2 and Python 3
